                        discover new topics to improve our lists.
                      </p>
                      <h1>Why should you speak at PyCon Colombia 2023?</h1>
                      <br>
                      <p>We strongly believe that if you have something you are really passionate about and you want to spread the word, 
                        you should craft a talk and do it! but, if that’s not enough to convince you, here is the list of perks you get by 
                        becoming a PyCon Colombia 2023 speaker:
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Free full conference pass</li>
                        <li>A professionally produced video of your talk published in our YouTube channel 
                            (see Talk Videos section for more details)</li>
                        <li>The opportunity to positively impact the lives of over 600 attendees</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h1>Our Selection Process</h1>
                      <br>
                      <p>In order to create the most valuable talks and workshops line-up for the conference 
                        we follow this process:
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <ol>
                        <li>All proposals reviews are anonymized, that way we avoid the bias towards the submitter.</li>
                        <li>All proposals are reviewed and voted by our Reviewers Team.</li>
                        <li>The best-rated proposals are de-anonymized to review the speaker's profile, this is made by 
                            the PyCon Colombia’s Talks Committee.</li>
                        <li>The Committee decides the final line-up.</li>
                      </ol>
                      <br>
                      <p>We are really excited to get a lot more excellent submissions than we have speaking slots. This 
                        process helps us to get the best proposals by trying to avoid the bias to the speaker profile.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <h1>Talks</h1>
                      <br>
                      <p>This is a space of 40 minutes (Including Q & A, commonly distributed in 30 minutes for talk, 
                        10 minutes for questions). if which you can speak of any subject (Not only Python-centric themes) 
                        using a slide deck and live demos if you wish
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <h1>Talk Videos</h1>
                      <br>
                      <p>We will record the talks and upload them to our YouTube channel, this includes a screen recording of 
                        the speaker’s slide deck, live demos, and speaker’s in-person activity. This benefits all the members 
                        of the Python community who can’t make it to PyCon Colombia. By submitting your proposal to PyCon Colombia,
                         you agree to give us permission to record, edit and release audio and/or video of your presentation. 
                         If you aren’t ok with this, please let us know and we will work this out.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>Also, since you own your slide deck, we would like to ask you to do them under an open-source license 
                        like Creative Commons
